# p-map

> Map over promises concurrently

Useful when you need to run promise-returning & async functions multiple times with different inputs concurrently.

This is different from `Promise.all()` in that you can:

* Control the concurrency
* Decide whether or not to stop iterating when there's an error
* Stop iterating at any point (like `break` in standard loops)

## Install

```
$ npm install p-map
```

## Usage

```js
import pMap from 'p-map';
import got from 'got';

const sites = [
	getWebsiteFromUsername('https://sindresorhus'), //=> Promise
	'https://avajs.dev',
	'https://github.com'
];

const mapper = async site => {
	const {requestUrl} = await got.head(site);
	return requestUrl;
};

const result = await pMap(sites, mapper, {concurrency: 2});

console.log(result);
//=> ['https://sindresorhus.com/', 'https://avajs.dev/', 'https://github.com/']
```

### Breaking from iteration

```js
import pMap from 'p-map';
import got from 'got';

const numbers = Array.from({ length: 2000 }).map((_, i) => i + 1);
//=> [1, 2, ..., 1999, 2000]

const mapper = async number => {
	if (number !== 404) {
		const { transcript } = await got(`https://xkcd.com/${number}/info.0.json`).json();
		if (/unicorn/.test(transcript)) {
			console.log('Found a XKCD comic with an unicorn:', number);
			return pMap.stop();
		}
	}
};

await pMap(numbers, mapper, { concurrency: 50 });
//=> Found a XKCD comic with an unicorn: 948
```

## API

### pMap(input, mapper, options?)

Returns a `Promise` that is fulfilled when all promises in `input` and ones returned from `mapper` are fulfilled, or rejects if any of the promises reject. The fulfilled value is an `Array` of the fulfilled values returned from `mapper` in `input` order.

#### input

Type: `Iterable<Promise | unknown>`

Iterated over concurrently in the `mapper` function.

#### mapper(element, index)

Type: `Function`

Expected to return a `Promise` or value.

#### options

Type: `object`

##### concurrency

Type: `number` *(Integer)*\
Default: `Infinity`\
Minimum: `1`

Number of concurrently pending promises returned by `mapper`.

##### stopOnError

Type: `boolean`\
Default: `true`

When set to `false`, instead of stopping when a promise rejects, it will wait for all the promises to settle and then reject with an [aggregated error](https://github.com/sindresorhus/aggregate-error) containing all the errors from the rejected promises.

### pMap.stop(options?)

Creates a special object that indicates to `pMap` that iteration must stop immediately. This object should just be returned from within the mapper (and not used directly for anything).

#### options

Type: `object`

##### value

Type: `any`\
Default: `undefined`

Value to provide as result for this iteration.

##### ongoingMappings

Type: `object`

Options to configure what `pMap` must do with any concurrent ongoing mappings at the moment `stop` is called.

###### collapse

Type: `boolean`\
Default: `false`

Whether or not to remove all holes from the result array (caused by pending mappings).

###### fillWith

Type: `any`\
Default: `undefined`

Value to use as immediate result for pending mappings, replacing holes from the result array.

This option is ignored if `collapse` is set to `true`.
